# Arduino-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
An obstacle avoider robot made using Arduino Uno R3, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and L293D motor driver
# Components
Arduino Uno, L293D motor driver, 1 HC-SR04, 2 DC/Gear motors, 1 9V battery, jumpers
# Theory
The HC-SR04 sonar emits ultrasonic sound waves and receives them. If there is an obstacle in front of the robot, the ultrasonic sound wave will be reflected back and the sensor will detect it. Then the robot will change its direction to avoid collision
